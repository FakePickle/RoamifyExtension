Rome
#1 in Best Places to Visit 
in Italy

A standard stop on many European vacation itineraries, Rome 
is not to be missed. Italy's capital city is a globally renowned 
cultural and historical powerhouse, boasting everything from ancient 
ruins and tranquil parks to Michelin-starred restaurants. Here, you'll 
find the most important relic from the Roman Empire (the Colosseum), 
some of Michelangelo's greatest works (in the Sistine Chapel), an 18th 
century Baroque-style fountain (the Trevi Fountain) and, of course, 
the center of Catholicism (Vatican City). Other can't-miss tourist 
attractions in the Eternal City include the Pantheon, the Roman Forum 
and St. Peter's Basilica, the world's largest church.

Florence
#2 in Best Places to Visit in Italy

Situated 
in the scenic Tuscan valley, Florence woos travelers with old-world 
avenues leading to lovely piazzas big and small. While you're soaking 
up the splendor, make sure to stop by the Piazza del Duomo, where the 
breathtaking Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral is located, and the 
romantic Ponte Vecchio, a 14th century bridge overlooking the Arno 
River. Once central to the Renaissance movement, Florence also offers 
art aficionados the opportunity to see famous pieces by Michelangelo 
and other iconic artists of that period. As a bonus, Florence is not 
too far from the Chianti wine region, which makes for a good day 
trip.

Venice
#3 in Best Places to Visit in 
Italy

There are few destinations in the world that are quite like 
Venice. Its uniqueness can largely be attributed to the canals that 
run through this northern Italian city like roads, carrying water 
taxis and buses in addition to its fleet of famous gondolas. As such, 
there is a palpable bustle here that may surprise some first-timers. 
For a relaxing Venice vacation, seek out the smaller streets and 
canals away from the busy Grand Canal and St. Mark's Square. Just be 
sure to stroll across Rialto Bridge and tour the grand St. Mark's 
Basilica at least once.

Amalfi Coast
#5 in Best Places to Visit in Italy

The 
journey to the cliffside Amalfi Coast involves heart-stopping, hairpin 
turns on narrow roads, but travelers agree this is part of the fun. 
The region covers more than 30 miles of coastline and is home to 13 
colorful seaside towns, each with its own story. Positano and Amalfi 
are the most popular, housing numerous hotels and sights. While here, 
hike, relax on the beach and eat to your heart's content (there are 
multiple Michelin-starred restaurants along the Amalfi Coast). For 
something more off-the-beaten-path, set your sights on Atrani. This 
humble fishing village boasts medieval whitewashed architecture, 
winding alleys and authentic Italian charm.

Sicily
#6 
in Best Places to Visit in Italy

As the location of several ancient 
Greek legends, Sicily has an almost mythical quality. Once you visit 
for yourself, you'll see why so many writers were inspired by this 
island, which happens to be the largest in the Mediterranean. Be 
enchanted by Sicily's crystal-clear waters and golden beaches. Marvel 
at Mount Etna, the highest active volcano in Europe, or try hiking up 
it in summer or skiing down it in winter. Also save time for taking in 
the many cultures that have called this island home at its various 
cathedrals and archaeological sites.

Tuscany, Italy

Places to Visit in Italy

If you're looking for jaw-dropping scenery, 
Tuscany is really all it's cracked up to be. Italy's famous 
countryside offers travelers spectacular landscapes dotted with

restaurants. Don't miss out on a visit to the walled city of San 
Gimignano, a UNESCO World Heritage Site famous for its medieval 
towers. What's more, Tuscan locales like Pisa (which offers much more 
than its leaning tower) and Siena are an easy drive from top 
destinations such as Bologna and Cinque Terre, perfect for daytrippers

Sardinia
#8 in Best Places to Visit in Italy

Sardinia 
provides the best of both worlds. Costa Smeralda is all about luxury, 
with its lush beaches and coves overlooking yacht-filled waters. And 
away from all of the glitz and glamour of Costa Smeralda, you'll find 
a more laid-back side of the island, including small medieval towns 
where Sardinians still practice sheepherding and wear traditional 
clothing. What's more, Sardinia features several ancient ruins, such 
as UNESCO World Heritage-listed Su Nuraxi di Barumini.

Capri
#9 in Best Places to Visit in Italy

For 
centuries, this small island off the coast of southern Italy has 
attracted plenty of famous faces, from emperors to movie stars, due to 
its gorgeous scenery. Some of Capri's most amazing sights are best

Grotto, where sunlight turns the water into an unbelievably vivid 
shade of blue. On land, the Gardens of Augustus and Villa Jovis, an 
imperial palace, also provide spectacular views. Meanwhile, in the 
town center, visitors will find high-end shops and restaurants where 
they can relax after a long day of sightseeing.

Lake 
Como
#10 in Best Places to Visit in Italy

If you really want to treat 
yourself on your next vacation, Lake Como is where you want to be. 
Here, opulent villas and hotels line the shores and serene beaches 
beckon to sun seekers. You'll see sleek sailboats and speedboats 
coasting in the middle of the lake, which is the perfect place to 
admire the region's surrounding hills. Meanwhile, for a lesson in 
luxury, tour one of the region's grand villas; top picks among 
travelers include Villa Melzi d'Eril, Villa Carlotta and Villa

Milan
#11 in Best 
Places to Visit in Italy

Italy's second-largest city is best known 
for its high fashion, playing host to Milan Fashion Week each year and 
home to iconic fashion houses including Giorgio Armani, Prada and 
Versace. Visitors can peruse such high-end brands at the dazzling 
Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II shopping arcade. But Milan's 
architecture (including the Gothic Milan Cathedral and grand Teatro 
alla Scala opera house) and sites like Castello Sforzesco (which holds 
nearly 10 museums and several other exhibitions) are worth a visit on 
their own. What's more, the city is incredibly walkable, so feel free 
to explore on foot – with or without designer stilettos.

or visit in winter to hit the slopes. Other top sights include the 
Three Peaks, one of the Dolomites' most recognizable features, and

Lake Garda
#13 in Best 
Places to Visit in Italy

Located about 30 miles from Verona, Lake 
Garda tends to be more approachable and wallet-friendly (if a bit more 
touristy) than Lake Como. Activities in this recreational hot spot 
include swimming and windsurfing, as well as hiking and taking a 
funicular to Mount Baldo. Lake Garda also attracts families with 
Gardaland Resort, which includes themed hotels as well as an amusement 
park, water park and aquarium. If you're looking to get away from the 
crowds, go beyond the main tourist sites to the quieter northern side 
of the lake, where you'll find the highest mountains and tucked-away 
towns.

Assisi
#19 in Best Places to 
Visit in Italy

Assisi, a medieval town with religious connections, 
sits on a hilltop in the lush landscapes of Umbria, just more than 100 
miles north of Rome. This peaceful town's biggest draws are its sights 
dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi, one of Italy's patron saints, 
including the Basilica of San Francesco, which houses his tomb as well 
as colorful frescos, and the Bosco di San Francesco. Beyond its 
religious heritage, Assisi is worth a visit for its picturesque 
streets and sweeping views, while its location also makes it ideal for 
a truffle hunting excursion or wine tasting tour.

Verona
#20 in Best Places to Visit in Italy

Best 
known for its Shakespeare ties, Verona appeals to fans of "Romeo and 
Juliet" with themed tours of the sights that allegedly inspired the 
play. But there is more to this city than its literary link. Verona, 
located less than 20 miles east of Lake Garda, is also home to several 
impressive attractions and historic buildings (the whole city is a 
UNESCO World Heritage Site, after all). Travelers won't want to miss 
the Arena di Verona, a first-century Roman amphitheater that is still 
in use, and Giardino Giusti, a beautifully sculpted Renaissance 
garden.
